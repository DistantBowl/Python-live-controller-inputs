# Python-live-controller-inputs
A small script to detect game controllers connected to a computer and monitor their inputs live.

This uses Ursina (a 3d game engin in python) to gather and monitor inputs from game controllers of most kinds, provided they are in the correct mode.
It's a standalone script so once the dependencies are installed you and run the script and begin monitoring. It's device selection and stuff are all
done in the console after running.

Feel free to use it as a guide for how to get the inputs from the device you want into python, and what button/axes you want to use.
