# Python-live-controller-inputs
A small script to detect game controllers connected to a computer and monitor their inputs live.

This uses Ursina (a 3d game engin in python) to gather and monitor inputs from game controllers of most kinds, provided they are in the correct mode.
It's a standalone script so once the dependencies are installed you can run the script and begin monitoring. It's device selection and stuff are all
done in the console, as it's a console based application.

Feel free to use it as a guide for how to get the inputs from the device you want into python, and what button/axes you want to use.

This has been tested on a variety of controllers from various makers (Xbox and Playstation most notably) as well as steering wheel rigs such as fanatech,
but it should work with more I just don't have them to test with.
